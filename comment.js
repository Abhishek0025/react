REACT:
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object =>HTMLElement(render)

React.createElement: Creates an object. When we render this element onto the DOM, it becomes HTML element
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Namaste React ðŸš€");
console.log(heading);

JSX is not part of React. We can write React without jsx also, but jsx akes our lives easy.
JSX is not HTML in JavaScript. JSX is HTML like syntax
JSX (Babel converts JSX to React.createElement) => transpiled to React.createElement => ReactElement-JS object => HTMLElement(render)
const heading = (
    <h1 id="heading" tabIndex="5">
        Welcome to Namaste React ðŸ˜„
    </h1>
); 
This is not pure JS. JS engine cannot read this code. Parcel is doing the job behind the scenes. Even before this code goes to the browser, it is transpiled before it goes to JS engine and then JS engine receives the code that browsers understand
JSX (transpiled before it reaches to JS) - PARCEL - Babel(JS Compiler)
console.log(heading)

If I have to render inside root, since we are dealing with browsers, we should use ReactDOM.createRoot
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")); //ReactDOM takes this object and pushes it to browser. Meaning, it will replace whatever is inside root from .html file to what is written in App.js. 
To render on HTML
root.render(heading);
